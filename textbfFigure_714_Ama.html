<div><b>Figure 7.14:</b> Amazon EKS use case (AWS Whitepapers).</div><div>Benefits of using Amazon EKS</div><div>The following are the benefits of using Amazon EKS [82]:</div><ul><li><b>Operational Efficiency:</b> EKS automates the setup, scaling, and
management of Kubernetes clusters, allowing users to focus on
developing and deploying applications.</li><li><b>Security:</b> Integrated with AWS IAM and <b>Virtual Private
Cloud (VPC)</b> , EKS ensures secure and isolated networking for
Kubernetes clusters.</li><li><b>Flexibility:</b> EKS provides flexibility by supporting both
standard Kubernetes tooling and AWS-specific integrations, giving
users the freedom to choose their preferred tools.</li></ul><div>Integration with DevOps workflow</div><div>Amazon EKS integrates seamlessly with DevOps workflows, enabling
developers to incorporate Kubernetes-based applications into their CI/CD
pipelines. EKS plays a pivotal role in modern DevOps practices by
seamlessly integrating Kubernetes-based applications into CI/CD
pipelines. This integration streamlines the deployment, testing, and
delivery of containerized applications, enhancing agility and
accelerating time-to-market for development teams.</div><div><b>Continuous Integration (CI)</b> : Amazon EKS integrates with CI
tools such as Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and AWS CodePipeline, enabling
automated build, test, and deployment processes. CI pipelines can
trigger Kubernetes deployments based on code commits, ensuring that new
features and updates are deployed consistently and efficiently.</div><div><b>Continuous Deployment (CD)</b> : Leveraging Amazon EKS,
organizations can automate the deployment of containerized applications
across development, testing, and production environments. EKS integrates
with tools like Helm for managing Kubernetes application packages and
AWS CodeDeploy for flexible deployment strategies, including blue-green
and rolling updates.</div><div><b>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</b> : EKS integrates seamlessly with
infrastructure provisioning tools such as AWS CloudFormation and
Terraform. This integration allows teams to define and manage Kubernetes
clusters, worker nodes, networking configurations, and application
deployments as code, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across
environments.</div><div><b>Monitoring and Logging</b> : Amazon EKS integrates with Amazon
CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray for monitoring and observability of Kubernetes
clusters and applications. Developers can set up alarms, collect
performance metrics, and trace application requests, enabling proactive
monitoring and rapid troubleshooting of issues.</div><div><b>Security and Compliance</b> : Integrated with AWS IAM and VPC
security features, Amazon EKS provides robust security controls for
Kubernetes clusters. DevOps teams can implement fine-grained access
policies, encryption at rest and in transit, and network isolation to
meet compliance requirements and protect sensitive data.</div><div><b>Scalability and High Availability</b> : EKS facilitates horizontal
scaling of applications based on demand, leveraging Kubernetes
autoscaling capabilities. Combined with AWS Availability Zones and
multi-region deployments, EKS ensures high availability and fault
tolerance for mission-critical applications, reducing downtime and
enhancing reliability.</div><div><b>Cost Optimization</b> : EKS optimizes resource utilization by
automatically scaling Kubernetes clusters based on workload
requirements. DevOps teams can leverage AWS Spot Instances for
cost-effective compute resources and use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor
and optimize Kubernetes cluster costs.</div><div><b>Summary</b> : Amazon EKS empowers DevOps teams with a comprehensive
suite of tools and integrations to automate and streamline the
deployment lifecycle of containerized applications. By combining the
scalability and flexibility of Kubernetes with AWS’s robust
infrastructure and DevOps ecosystem, EKS enables organizations to
achieve faster innovation cycles, improved operational efficiency, and
enhanced collaboration between development and operations teams.</div>
