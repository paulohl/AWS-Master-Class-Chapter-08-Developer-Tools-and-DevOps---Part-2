<h1 data-label="amazon-elastic-container-registry" class="ltx_title_section">Amazon Elastic Container Registry</h1><div>Amazon <b>Elastic Container Registry (ECR</b> ) is a fully managed
container registry service that makes it easy for developers to store,
manage, and deploy Docker container images. This section provides an
in-depth exploration of Amazon ECR, its features, and its role in the
containerization ecosystem.
Overview
Amazon ECR simplifies the containerization process by providing a secure
and scalable repository for Docker images. Developers can use ECR to
store, manage, and deploy Docker images, making it an integral part of
the container lifecycle.
Key features of Amazon ECR
The following are the key features of Amazon ECR:</div><ul><li><b>Secure and private repositories:</b> ECR allows users to create
private container repositories, ensuring that container images are
securely stored and only accessible to authorized users and systems
[78].</li><li><b>Integration with AWS Services:</b> Seamless integration with
other AWS services, such as Amazon ECS and Kubernetes, streamlines the
deployment of containerized applications.</li><li><b>Scalability:</b> ECR is designed to scale with the needs of the
development team, supporting the storage and retrieval of many
container images [79].</li></ul><div>Use cases
The following are the use cases of Amazon ECR [78]:</div><ul><li><b>Microservices architecture:</b> ECR is well-suited for
organizations adopting microservices architecture, providing a
centralized registry for managing and versioning container images.</li><li><b>Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD):</b> Integrating ECR with CI/CD pipelines facilitates the automated
building, testing, and deployment of containerized applications.</li><li><b>Collaborative development:</b> Developers working on
collaborative projects can leverage ECR to share and deploy container
images efficiently across the development team.</li></ul><div>Figure 7.12 below shows AWS Containers options by layer</div>
