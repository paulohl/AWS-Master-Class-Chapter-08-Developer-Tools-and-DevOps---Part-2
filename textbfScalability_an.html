<div><b>Scalability and Integration</b></div><div>One of the defining features of Amazon ECS is its scalability. ECS
dynamically scales containers in response to workload demands,
leveraging AWS Auto Scaling and integration with Elastic Load Balancing
(ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across container instances for
optimal performance. This scalability feature makes ECS ideal for both
microservices architectures, where individual components can scale
independently, and for batch processing workloads that require elastic
compute resources.</div>
