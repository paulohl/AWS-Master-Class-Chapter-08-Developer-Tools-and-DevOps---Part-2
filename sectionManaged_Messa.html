<h1 data-label="managed-message-queues" class="ltx_title_section">Managed Message Queues</h1><div>Managed message queues are an integral part of modern cloud
architectures, providing a scalable and reliable mechanism for
decoupling components. This section explores the concept of managed
message queues, highlighting their significance in distributed systems.
Overview
Managed message queues, such as Amazon SQS, Azure Queue Storage, and
Google Cloud Pub/Sub, offer a reliable and scalable solution for
building asynchronous communication between distributed components. This
section focuses on the general principles and advantages associated with
managed message queues.
Advantages
The following are the advantages of managed message queues:</div><ul><li><b>Scalability:</b> Managed message queues automatically scale to
accommodate varying workloads, ensuring consistent performance as the
system evolves [75].</li><li><b>Reliability:</b> By offloading the responsibility of message
storage and delivery to a managed service, the reliability of message
processing is enhanced<sup>91</sup>.</li><li><b>Decoupling:</b> Managed message queues facilitate the decoupling
of producers and consumers, enabling asynchronous communication and
reducing dependencies between components [76].</li></ul><div>Use cases
The following are the use cases of managed message queues [54]:</div><div><b>Microservices architectures:</b> Managed message queues play a
crucial role in microservices architectures, allowing services to
communicate asynchronously without direct dependencies.</div><div><b>Event-driven systems:</b> In event-driven systems, managed
message queues enable the seamless flow of events between different
components, supporting real-time processing.</div><div>Best practices
The following are the best practices of manages message queues [54]:</div><div><b>Message retention:</b> Configure message retention policies to
align with the specific needs of the application, balancing the
trade-off between storage costs and the time-sensitive nature of
messages.</div><div><b>Error handling:</b> Implement robust error-handling mechanisms,
including dead-letter queues, to manage messages that cannot be
processed successfully.</div><div>Integration with AWS Services
Managed message queues integrate seamlessly with various AWS services,
enhancing their capabilities and extending their use in different
scenarios. Some notable integrations include [54]:</div><div><b>AWS Lambda:</b> Utilize managed message queues to trigger
serverless functions in AWS Lambda, enabling serverless and
event-driven architectures.</div><div><b>Amazon EC2:</b> Integrate managed message queues with Amazon EC2
instances to enable communication between different components of a
distributed application.</div>
