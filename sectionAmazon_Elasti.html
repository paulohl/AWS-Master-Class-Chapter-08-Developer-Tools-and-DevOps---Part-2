<h1 data-label="amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service" class="ltx_title_section">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes
Service</h1><div>Amazon EKS is a fully managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS,
offering a simplified yet powerful platform for deploying, managing, and
scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes.
Overview
Amazon EKS abstracts the complexity of setting up and maintaining a
Kubernetes control plane, providing a reliable and scalable solution for
running containerized applications using Kubernetes orchestration.
Key features of Amazon EKS
The following are the key features of Amazon EK
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) [82] simplifies the
deployment, management, and scaling of Kubernetes clusters on AWS,
catering to the needs of organizations adopting container orchestration.
EKS integrates seamlessly with AWS services, providing a robust platform
for running containerized applications with Kubernetes.
Amazon EKS Architecture
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) empowers organizations to
efficiently deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters on AWS, leveraging
robust infrastructure for scalable container orchestration.
Amazon EKS architecture encompasses essential components that streamline
the deployment and operation of Kubernetes clusters within the AWS cloud
environment. Central to this architecture are the control plane, worker
nodes, and clusters, each playing a pivotal role in ensuring the
scalability, reliability, and performance of containerized applications
orchestrated by EKS.<b>Control Plane:</b> At the core of Amazon EKS is the control plane,
managed entirely by AWS. This critical component comprises control plane
nodes that oversee and coordinate the Kubernetes master components.
These components include the API server, scheduler, and controller
manager, which collectively manage the lifecycle and state of Kubernetes
clusters.<b>Worker Nodes:</b> Integral to EKS are worker nodes, which execute
the containers hosting applications. These nodes are responsible for
running Kubernetes’ worker components, including kubelet and kube-proxy,
and maintaining communication with the control plane. Worker nodes
ensure the efficient deployment and operation of containerized workloads
orchestrated by EKS.<b>Clusters:</b> EKS clusters serve as logical groupings of worker
nodes within which containerized applications are deployed and managed.
These clusters leverage AWS infrastructure capabilities such as EC2
instances or AWS Fargate, offering flexibility in scaling and resource
allocation based on application requirements. EKS clusters enable
organizations to harness the power of Kubernetes for scalable and
resilient application deployment on AWS.
