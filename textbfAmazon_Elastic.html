<div><b>Amazon Elastic Container Service</b></div><div>Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service provided
by AWS. This section explains the features, architecture, and use cases
of ECS, highlighting its role in simplifying the deployment and
management of containerized applications.</div><div>Overview</div><div>Amazon ECS enables users to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a
cluster. It abstracts the underlying infrastructure complexities,
allowing developers to focus on building and scaling applications
without managing the underlying infrastructure.</div><div>Key features of Amazon ECS</div><div>Following are the key features of Amazon ECS [80]:</div><ul><li><b>Scalability:</b> ECS provides auto-scaling capabilities, allowing
the automatic adjustment of the number of running containers based on
application load.</li><li><b>Integration with Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):</b> Seamless
integration with ELB facilitates the distribution of incoming
application traffic across multiple ECS containers.</li><li><b>Task definitions:</b> Users define their applications through
task definitions, specifying parameters such as the Docker image, CPU
and memory requirements, and container links.</li></ul><div>Amazon ECS Architecture</div><div>Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) simplifies the deployment and
management of containerized applications on AWS infrastructure. At its
core, ECS (refer to Figure 7.13 below) _ allows users to run Docker
containers across a managed cluster of EC2 instances or Fargate, AWS’s
serverless compute engine for containers. This service abstracts the
complexities of orchestrating containers, enabling developers to focus
on application development and scalability rather than infrastructure
management.</div>
