<div><b>Components of Amazon ECS</b></div><div>Amazon ECS architecture revolves around several key components:
clusters, tasks, and services. Clusters are logical groupings of EC2
instances or Fargate tasks where containers are deployed and managed.
Within these clusters, tasks represent discrete units of work, each
defined by a task definition that specifies Docker image, resource
requirements, and dependencies. ECS services, on the other hand, ensure
the continuous availability and scalability of tasks by managing their
lifecycle, including scaling based on demand and maintaining a desired
state of tasks running in the cluster.</div>
